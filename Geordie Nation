Purpose of Geordie Nation was originally a second YouTube channel handle but i expanded the idea since then, the reason is i have came across several forms of artificial intelligence which when i asked the questions it started to write code out for me, and this code did surprise me because other applications did not do this. so where i am at at this current moment is the name of a brand new App which is to include the following sections and this will be based in the Northeast of England where i was born in the City of Newcastle upon Tyne
Northeast news section covering local news from the chronicle live, and other outlets based in the city reporting about local events in the Northeast but centered from Newcastle upon Tyne as far up as Berwick and as far South as Miiddlesbourgh.
All Newcastle United YouTube channel's from those at the top ie, Adam Pearson1242, currently on 54K subscribers, NUFCMatters 52.6K and Tyneside Life 52.2K,and  Magpie ChannelTV 35.8k Newcastle Fans TV 44.2k The Toon Review 33.2K, and John Sinclair TV 23.2k and Gallowgate Shots NUFC 11.2k Through Black and White Eyes 7.09K and Loaded Mag NUFC 24.8k and EverMore-NUFC 8.86k and Everythig I s Black & White - Newcastle United 6.3K and PD PROUDLOCK 2.28k and Black and White Banter 5.32K so that is a lot of YouTube channels just mentioned and my wish is to have a section that covers them all and #paulgallant3675 which is my small channel and for us to all grow up to 100K in subscribers using Geordie Nation App to achieve this incredible feat
The above named channels covering Newcastle United fc and other channels covering Rugby at Newcastle Falcons down at Kingston Park and every other sports event like the racing form Gosforth Park and Golf and Speedway if this still happens so lots to apply here.
Business section ie, all city centre business, and all outside business again up to Berwick upon Tweed and South to Middlesbourgh area. the idea is to cover and help as many as possible for a Â£9.99 price each month for life one set price that never changes with directory for retail, food and so on covering the entire spectrum of Northeast Maps and where they are found linked to my super app
