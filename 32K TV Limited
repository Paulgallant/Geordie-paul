With broadcasting updated cameras capable of crystal clear picture quality far above what other broadcasters currently offer so a major jump is the purpose of this token as we move towards 2030 and both Television sets and broadcasting of said picture
32K TV sets will start at 65 Inch diagnol line across the screen up to 100 Inch plus at the highest in the range of television sets available and priced depending how big you wish to purchase the television set the customer is wishing to purchase. 
Holographic image or video content: Split between Broadcasting in studio on the screens behind presenters on set in studio.
