32K TV Limited I believe is the future of both television broadcasting but also TV as we know them today which is not even at 8K so this is about technology which i want to integrate with 3D with a picture which is suspended in front of viewer's to 30 inch from main panel for truly hologram effect using technology we will bring to the people in any size above 65 inch size screen in TV sets . With broadcasting updated cameras capable of crystal clear picture quality far above what other broadcasters currently offer so a major jump is the purpose of this token as we move towards 2030 and both Television sets and broadcasting of said picture
32K TV is something i believe is possible and in this statement i will show you it has to be split into 2 lanes for this to work Broadcasting using redesigned cameras where we rebuild the camera completely the color palette and the way it will show the end result on screen as my true wish is to have to image come out to the viewer using new hardware to enable the image to rise forward from the screen to give the effect it is floating before your eyes, which is complex and will cost as i type this for you to read the ERC20 token is named but is yet to be verified as i have no idea how to achieve this goal the token is built my wish with this is to show the World what i believe can be achieved as it is my opinion television entertainment needs to change and evolve which is the purpose you are reading here, Broadcasting needs to change it needs to be upgraded to a brand new standard not to become super rich by any means to show what can be achieved through re-thinking Television and broadcasting for the 22nd Century to give the viewer an image on their screen which will immerse them no matter what they watch be that films, or sports of any kind like football with no break-up in the quality shown to the veiwer and on the final test units no increase in the price paid for owning a television or the service provided from the broadcasting service upon the final unit to be proposed for sale on broadcasting side however some change on the television set side as 65 inch through to 100 inch plus would come at a premium in higher price as you move up in set size.
