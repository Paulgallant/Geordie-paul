Geordie coins available for the Geordie nation in Newcastle upon Tyne in the Northeast of England I had the idea 2017 when i lived and worked in the area to design a cryptocurrency coin to help establish business across our region to many empty shops my key phrase was Geordie Notes to use for an exchange in the city centre however i created the ERC20 but nothing else as i was having stress from work during this time.
The concept was simple use the ERC20 to acquire office space in the city centre to create an exchange where the main goal was to spread the word of crypto-currency to shop keepers and owners across the whole of the northeast of England because there was many shops i would see that were empty selling nothing way back then, the concept back then was to tell business owners cryptocurrency was here to help shops to stay open using Geordie Notes in store to pay for purschases instead of using FIAT currency as a form of payment the price would be pegged to the real Pound Sterling 1-1.
Staff would recieve payments which would be converted from the ERC20 to USDT back to Pound Sterling to pay wages, and bonuses for shop or businesses who signed up to grow the adoption of their business or place of work using Geordie Notes for the sale of good's or a service to customers, at there location within the Northeast of England.
Cryptocurrency has been frowned upon which is wrong and many refuse to accept that this could happen one day, I never set out to become a wealthy person doing this so if as you read my words you believe that you are wrong it is helping build a network of understanding that there is another way we can do business which can create real value as we move forward in time using the ERC20 to purchase land or business premises to use for work purposes, giving good people the hope of an honest days work with either the chance to earn and learn at the same time while spreading the word about adoption sooner rather than later to help grow a commonunity.
